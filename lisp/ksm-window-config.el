;;; ksm-window-config --- provides handy window configuration functions
;;;
;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; I frequently find myself in a situation where I have half a dozen Emacs
;;; windows in a frame, and I want to focus on just one of those windows for a
;;; few moments, and then later return my window state to its present
;;; configuration.  Emacs already has facilities for accomplishing such tasks,
;;; but I wanted a quick toggle function like tmux' "C-b z" pane toggling
;;; feature.
;;;
;;; Use:
;;;
;;; I put this file somewhere Emacs will find it, then added the below to my
;;; ~/.emacs/init.el file.
;;;
;;;    (require 'ksm-window-config)
;;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x w") #'ksm/window-zoom-out)
;;;
;;; Some people might like to override the default key-binding for the
;;; 'delete-other-windows' function, as it has a similar purpose to this
;;; library's zoom-in function:
;;;
;;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 1") #'ksm/window-zoom-in)
;;;
;;; However, to force myself to learn learn tmux like key-bindings, I bind the
;;; zoom-in function to "C-x z" and rebind "C-x 1" to print a friendly reminder
;;; message.
;;;
;;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x 1") #'(lambda() (interactive) (message "Use C-x z")))
;;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x z") #'ksm/window-zoom-in) ; similar key-binding to tmux
;;;
;;; Sometimes I want to name a particular window configuration and quickly
;;; return to it. Perhaps I'm working on Project A and a colleague asks me to
;;; clarify how something in Project B works.  I save my window configuration
;;; with a string name, such as "a", open up other files to answer the question,
;;; then can restore my window configuration as it was before I loaded other
;;; files.
;;;
;;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x p") #'ksm/window-config-save)
;;;    (global-set-key (kbd "C-x j") #'ksm/window-config-restore)
